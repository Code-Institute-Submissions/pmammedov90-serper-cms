# SERPER-CMS

Welcome to the Serper Course Management System! This Python program provides a simple yet effective way to manage university foundation courses and pupil registrations. With this system, you can view course details, register pupils, grade them, and display their progress.

## Features

- View detailed information about available courses.
- Register pupils with their ID, name, and selected course.
- Grade pupils by entering their grades for individual units.
- Display the progress of pupils, including average grades and results.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: _git clone https://github.com/pmammedov90/serper-cms.git
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt, and go to the project directory: **_cd serper-cms**
4. **Install numpy library**: If you're encountering an issue with **import numpy as np**, it might be due to the fact that the numpy library is not installed in your Python environment. Here's how you can install numpy using pip: 
    1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
    2. Run the following command to install numpy: **pip install numpy**
    3. Wait for the installation process to complete. 
    4. You should see output indicating the installation progress.

Once the installation is complete, you should be able to use import numpy as np in your Python code without any issues.
5. **Run the Program**: Start the Course Management System by executing the main script: _**python run.py**_


## Usage

1. **Main Menu**: Choose an option from the main menu:

- **View Courses**: Explore available courses and their descriptions.
- **Register Pupil**: Register a new pupil with their ID, name, and chosen course.
- **Grade Pupil**: Enter grades for each unit to assess the pupil's progress.
- **Display Progress**: View a summary of each pupil's average grade and result.
- **Exit**: Quit the program.

2. **Follow the Prompts**: Depending on your selection, follow the prompts to interact with the system and manage courses and pupils.

3. **Grading Units**: When grading pupils, the program will prompt you to enter grades for each of the 8 units. Grades should be entered as numerical values (0-100).

## Notes

- Make sure to have the necessary course information files in the "files" directory.
- For grading, enter grades for each unit in sequence from 1 to 8.
